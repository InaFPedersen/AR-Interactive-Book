# AR-Interactive-Book
During my studies at University of Agder, I took a course (MM-505) Virtual and Augmented reality in the year 2020.
In this course I learned the basics within both Augmented Reality and Virtual Reality.

While learning about Augmented Reality (AR), I was challenge to create a game or an app using AR. 
I choose to create an Interactive Childrens Book. 
Where you could scan the pages of the book with an AR application on your phone, and an animation fitting the books content will occure.
